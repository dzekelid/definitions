name: API Blueprint
description: API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A
  couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect
  for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick
  prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read ??? after
  all it is just a form of plain text.
